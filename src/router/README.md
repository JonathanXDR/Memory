# Router
The router in Vue.js enables you to have different views. One might be mounted to /help, another one to /contact-us.
If you now call one of the routes eg. http://localhost:8080/help the respective view will be served to you.
See the [Vue.js Router Documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/) for more detailed information.
